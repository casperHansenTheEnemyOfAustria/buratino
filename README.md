# Buratino Instruction App
The purpose of this project is to develop an instruction app, that will be used by Buratino AB. The application will be built on HTML, CSS and JS, and be translated to mobile versions through Apache Cordova. The design will be derived from the Figma-prototype, with updates to the design added over the course of development.
